                <h1>The Importance of PROPER tree Identification</h1>
                <p>There are many reasons why proper Identification is important.  One of the biggest reasons is pest/disease prevention and Identification. There are a slew of pest out there that, for the most part, don't care what species to attack. However, some of the most damaging do go after specific species. Just knowing what species of tree you are dealing with can tell you what signs or symptoms you should be looking for. For instance, there are many insects that will bore into the phloem of a tree to feed or lay eggs. Take the lilac ash borer. Even though they cause damage to lilacs, ash trees, and privet; it is treatable and rarely fatal.  The EAB or Emerald Ash Borer that has been sweeping the nation for over 20 years, has killed tens of millions of Ash trees in 30 states.  There are treatments to TRY and prevent infection but once an infection has begun themortality rate is over 99%. The EAB has recently broken quarentine and has been discovered in the Denver area. </p>

                <p>Just by seeing the signs and symptoms we can keep track of these infestations to mitigate as much of the problems as possible.  This is one of the more recent problems in the tree world. But it is no where near the first.  Other examples would be the Chestnut blight fungus (Chryphonectria parasitica) that was discovered in 1904 and quickly spread through the nation.  By 1950 it had killed nearly all American Chestnuts.  For nearly 20 years now the Mountain Pine Beetle has been doing major damage to several species of pine trees across the forests of Colorado. It has claimed the lives of millions of Lodgepole, Limber, Scotch, Ponderosa Pines and even some Pinion and Bristlecone Pines. The Walnut twig beetle it's self (as a vector) is not very damaging.  However when it comes to Black Walnut Trees it spreads a fungus called Thousand Canker disease. This is a fatal infection within just a couple years of first showing Symptoms.  Dutch Elm disease was first detected in 1928, and discovered in Denver in 1948. Within 20 years it had absolutly destroyed the population of Elm Trees in Denver.  This disease is also not curable, but if caught early enough the tree can be preserved for period of time. The list goes on.  The prior examples are why transporting firewood more than 25 miles in the state of Colorado is illegal. And as stated previously why educational diligence is so important in the aboraculture industry.</p>
                <p>Preventing diseases and pests are not the only reason, however, why proper tree identification is important. Understanding the needs of different tree species is also important for site selection, maintenance and even safety.  Every tree has evolved to have very specific needs.  Some of them can be slightly flexable as long as other main requirements are met.  But if you value your (or your clients) trees, you must start by knowing what the tree needs first.  You should always pay attention to the different requirements, ie: Space, cold hardieness, light, water, nutrience, and soil.</p>
                <p>If you plant a tree under a powerline, you might want to make sure it's mature height isn't 65 feet.  If you live in the mountains of Colorado (or most anywhere in Colorado for that matter), you might rethink the Japanese Maple (or a palm tree) you want in your front yard due to the difference in Hardiness Zones. You can check your Hardiness Zone at the bottom of this page.</p>
                <p>As well, when it comes to safety, every tree is different. Just because a tree is very large and has heavy wood doesn't mean it's strong. Cottonwoods, for example, are a major species here in colorado.  They are fast growing trees that allocate there produced energy to growing fast instead of strong. When I was still a bit new to climbing, I learned this lesson well.  I had climbed many Pine trees and Ash trees, which have strong wood and great branch connections. So I went to set a line about 45 feet off the ground and my co-worker told me the 6" branch I had my rope on probably wasn't a good idea.  I laughed it off and hooked up anyway.  Luckily though, I decided to do a bounce test before I started the ascent. After I landed flat on my back, I was able to franticly crawl backward off a brick wall, landing in some rose bushes before the entire limb landed on the ground infront of me.</p>
                <p>In regards to maintenance, every species has different charicteristics.  Every tree species will allocate their produced energy to 2 or three of the five things.  But never all 5.  These are:  Growth speed, strength, healing (CODIT), reproduction. </p>
                <p>To sum it all up, improper identification and knowledge can cost you or someone else, so much time, money, embarrassment, or even your life. Once you know the basics, it's pretty easy.  But the most important aspect in being able to properly identify a tree is experience.  So even if you are new on your journey keep at it, ask questions, pay attention and have fun!!</p>
